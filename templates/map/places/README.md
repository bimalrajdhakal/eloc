Store Locator Library for the Google Maps JavaScript API v3
==============

This library enables developers to easily build store locator-type applications using the Google Maps JavaScript API v3.
![Analytics](https://maps-ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-12846745-20/js-store-locator/readme?pixel)

The library provides the following features:

* Pluggable data source – display stores from a data source of your choosing
* HTML5 Geolocation – determines a good initial viewport for the user
* Info window – shows details about a store
* Street View
* Extensible – customise your own markers, info windows, etc.
* Fully-featured side panel, providing:
  * Feature filtering
  * Autocomplete search
  * List of nearby stores
  * Directions

## Examples/Demos

The best way to become acquainted with the library is to see some of the examples:

1. [panel.html](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/examples/panel.html) – A simple store locator, including panel. Data is fetched from a static CSV file.
2. [dynamic.html](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/examples/dynamic.html) – Same as above, except stores are fetched dynamically from a JSONP web service.
3. [gme.html](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/examples/gme.html) – Same as above, except stores are fetched dynamically from Google Maps Engine.
4. [custom.html](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/examples/custom.html) – Various customisations to the default UI including custom markers and info window.
5. [places.html](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/examples/places.html) – Places are searched using the Google Places API, and displayed as a store locator.

## Reference documentation

For detailed documentation on the library, including classes, events and sample usage, please see the [reference documentation](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/reference.html).

## Quick Start

To get started, include the [store-locator.min.js](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-store-locator/blob/gh-pages/dist/store-locator.min.js) file on your HTML page. A set of [CSS styles](https://github.com/googlemaps/js-store-locator/blob/gh-pages/css/storelocator.css) are also available, which provide styling for store details and side panel.

The library's functions are contained under the `storeLocator` namespace. The main class is called `storeLocator.View`. A `View` has two required parameters, a `google.maps.Map`, and a `storeLocator.DataFeed`.

A `DataFeed` is an object with the function `getStores`. This function is called each time the map needs an update. A simple example of a `DataFeed` can be found in the [reference](https://googlemaps.github.io/js-store-locator/reference.html#storeLocator.DataFeed).
